# hey, i'm vro

dev, student, and a ~~professional~~ linux fan.

i mostly write in **go**, **zig**, ~~**python**~~, and **typescript (on bun)**
because i like my tools fast, weird, and slightly unhinged. i use **arch, btw**.

i'm currently working on an ai vtuber, a wpm tracker, some networking stuff like
**http/ws-over-webrtc** and probably rewriting something i already finished for
no good reason. if it involves performance, systems, or building cursed-but-interesting things, i'm in.

you can catch me:

- refusing to use docker on moral grounds (podman \<3)
- building things nobody asked for
- writing weird tools that only i will use
- writing stuff from scratch when i couldve used a library (not always tho :)

hit me up if you want:

- an opinionated take on your stack
- or just someone to argue with
