# hey, i'm vro

dev, student, and a ~~professional~~ linux fan.

i mostly write in **typescript (on bun)**, _**zig**_, **go**, and ~~**python**~~, 
because i like my tools fast, and simple. i use **arch, btw**.

i'm currently working on a web framework, a public chat app, experimenting with markov chains and stuff and
probably rewriting something i already finished for no good reason. if it involves performance, systems,
or building cursed-but-interesting things, i'm in.

you can catch me:

- refusing to use docker on moral grounds (podman \<3)
- building things nobody asked for
- writing weird tools that only i will use
- writing stuff from scratch when i couldve used a library (not always tho :)

hit me up if you want someone to argue with :3
